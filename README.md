## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using JavaScript I built a basic calculator. The user has the ability to set perform simple arithmetic calculations through the inputs. When the user enters a number and operator, the calculator stores these values then allows for a second input as well. After clicking on "=" the answer is displayed in the input field. Using object-oriented programming, I designed a calculator object with 3 properties and simple methods to do various calculations.

## Lessons Learned:

Object oriented programming, and CSS Grid.
