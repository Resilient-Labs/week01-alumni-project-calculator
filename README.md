## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** little bit of HTML, CSS & a lot of Javascript

So I took a previous version of a JS calculator and I converted it into an object-oriented program.

## Lessons Learned:

This was the first project i did with OOP so this helped me with learning the structure and overall syntax of OOP.  

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
