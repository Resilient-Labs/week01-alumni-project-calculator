## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Styling for this project was done using a CSS Grid layout. Calculator behavior was written implementing object oriented programming in Javascript.

## Optimizations
Found it more efficient to iterate through a class of buttons vs having to write a different click event for each button.

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first attempt at writing a project with object oriented programming. Enjoyed that OOP kept my Javascript really organized.
